    h1 Privacy Policy
    p
      | Redsmin Software Inc ("Redsmin") operates several websites including image-charts.com and related subdomains. It is Redsmin's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
    h2 Website Visitors
    p
      | Like most website operators, Redsmin collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Redsmin's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Redsmin's visitors use its website and to better provide related content to its visitors. From time to time, Redsmin may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    p
      | Redsmin also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Redsmin only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
    h2 Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
    p
      | Certain visitors to Redsmin's websites choose to interact with Redsmin in ways that require Redsmin to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Redsmin gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a account at Redsmin.com to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Redsmin - by purchasing access to the Redsmin paid service, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Redsmin collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Redsmin. Redsmin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
    h2 Aggregated Statistics
    p
      | Redsmin may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Redsmin may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Redsmin does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
    h2 Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
    p
      | Redsmin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Redsmin's behalf or to provide services available at Redsmin's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Redsmin's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Redsmin will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Redsmin discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Redsmin believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Redsmin, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Redsmin website and have supplied your email address, Redsmin may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Redsmin and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Redsmin takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
